Homework3 Banker:

1) Please use "cd" command
to get into the folder called src.
command: cd src

2) Then, compile the Linker Class
command: javac Banker.java

3) After the source files have been compiled, now we can supply the main method in Linker class with file name (type the file path after Linker):

command: java Banker [the relative or absolute path of your file]

For example, java Banker input-01.txt (which is in the file of src)
The result will be printed to console (terminal).
